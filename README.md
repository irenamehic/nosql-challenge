The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

In NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb we needed to import data, create a MongoDB database, and clean the database. In NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb, we need to run different queiries to answer these main questions:
  1. Which establishments have a bad hygiene score (equal to 20)? 
  2. Which establishments in London have a Rating Value greater than or equal to 4? 
   3: What are the top 5 establishments with a Rating Value of 5, sorted by best hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant, "Penang Flavours"? 
   4: How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Results show the top ten Local Authority Areas?
